# LAMPS

Learning / Adversarial learning using Matrix Product States  

Based on "Supervised Learning with Quantum Inspired Tensor Networks" http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05775  
Powered by [**pyUni10**](https://uni10-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) -- the python wrapper of [**Uni10**](https://github.com/yingjerkao/uni10) library (v1.0)

# Current project status

Infrastructure for MPS Learning mostly done  
Adversarial learning not yet implemented

# Requirements
 - [pyUni10-v1.0](https://uni10-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or [pyUni10-rev](https://github.com/cylo/uni10) (for multiprocessing)
 - python 2.7 (pyUni10-v1.0 lives in python2)
 - NumPy > 1.12.0
 - scikit-image
